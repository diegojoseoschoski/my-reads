# MyReads Project

This project is an application built in React to move books from one shelf into another. Books can
be added into three bookshelves currently reading, want to read, and read.  

Books can be moved from one shelf to another from the main page, or by adding a book through searching.  
When the add button is clicked the search page will be displayed.  On the search page a book can be 
searched for and added into one of the three bookshelves.

## Deployment Instructions

To run this project:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Search Terms

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in SEARCH_TERMS.md and are shown below. That list of terms are the only terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
