# MyReads Project

This project is an application built in React to move books from one shelf into another. Books can
be added into three bookshelves currently reading, want to read, and read.  

Books can be moved from one shelf to another from the main page, or by adding a book through searching.  
When the add button is clicked the search page will be displayed.  On the search page a book can be 
searched for and added into one of the three bookshelves.
